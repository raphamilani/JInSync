<p>Working as a mainframe professional since 2002, I realized the missing a tool that would help in reading the information of files EBCDIC and also in the information of the copybooks themselves.</p>

<p>This tool was developed with the purpose of facilitating the reading of the COBOL copybook and facilitating the reading of files that use the copybook.</p>

<p>The tool has three functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Copybook: Read the copybook and demonstrate the characteristics of each field, such as data type, initial position and size;</li>
<li>String: Perform the breaking of a String based on the copybook informed, making it easier to read the information;</li>
<li>File: Read a file in EBCDIC format and break the information.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have FTP access, you can also read the mainframe directly. Just fill in the IP and the username and password.</p>

<p>As my main knowledge is mainframe, the source code developed is not as organized as a java professional is accustomed to. I've tried splitting the sources into the MVC structure so it's easy to understand.</p>

<p>I hope the tool can help the mainframe professionals who felt the same need I had.</p>
